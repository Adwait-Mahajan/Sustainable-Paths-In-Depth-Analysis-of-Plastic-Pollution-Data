# Sustainable-Paths-In-Depth-Analysis-of-Plastic-Pollution-Data
<br>
In this study, we delve into the intricate landscape of global plastic pollution, honing our focus on the pivotal roles played by parent companies and individual countries. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years, our investigation is geared towards unraveling the complex dynamics surrounding plastic consumption. By meticulously examining the distribution of various plastic types, including HDPE, LDPE, PET, and more, we aim to shed light on the environmental ramifications of these materials.Our analytical approach involves a comparative study that scrutinizes the patterns of plastic usage across diverse parent companies and countries. Through the lens of descriptive statistics and visually compelling charts, we unravel key trends and disparities that underscore the intricate web of plastic pollution on a global scale. Our findings not only pinpoint variations in plastic consumption but also serve as a foundation for understanding the broader implications for environmental sustainability.

About the DATASET: 
<br>
The dataset utilized in this analysis was obtained from the open-source platform GitHub, reflecting a commitment to transparency and accessibility. This particular dataset encapsulates a comprehensive view of plastic pollution, drawing from cleanup efforts across various countries in the years 2019 and 2020. The dataset's inclusion of multiple variables, ranging from the country of cleanup and the year to detailed counts of different plastic types, provides a rich source of information for our exploration. Bias in the data may arise from several sources, and it is crucial to acknowledge these potential influences. One source of bias could be the geographic distribution of cleanup efforts, as certain regions may be more actively involved in plastic cleanup initiatives than others. Additionally, the choice of parent companies and the type of plastics included in the dataset may introduce bias, especially if it is not representative of the entire spectrum of plastic pollution sources. Awareness of these biases is essential for interpreting the findings accurately. The key features, or columns, selected for analysis include 'country,' 'year,' and counts for specific plastic types: 'hdpe' (High-Density Polyethylene), 'ldpe' (Low-Density Polyethylene), 'o' (Other), 'pet' (Polyester), 'pp' (Polypropylene), 'ps' (Polystyrene), and 'pvc' (PVC). These plastic types represent a broad spectrum of materials commonly found in the environment and contribute significantly to plastic pollution. The focus on these specific features allows for a nuanced examination of the distribution and impact of different plastics across countries and over time. The 'grand_total' column, representing the overall count of all types of plastic, serves as a consolidated measure of plastic pollution. Additionally, the 'num_events' and 'volunteers' columns provide insight into the scale and community involvement in cleanup efforts, adding a social dimension to the analysis. By narrowing our focus to specific plastic types and relevant contextual features, we aim to distill meaningful insights from the data, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the global plastic pollution landscape. As we proceed with the analysis, attention to the limitations and potential biases in the dataset will be paramount for generating robust and actionable conclusions.
